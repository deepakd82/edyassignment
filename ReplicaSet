When we want to run a process on all the nodes of the cluster, we can run cron jobs when a node boots (or) reboots. 
As These are run on the node itself, we have few drawbacks such as dependency on the specific runtime environments, terminating once the node is evicted.
To fulfill this, K8s has comeup with a controlled called as Daemon Set, which is basically created for a purpose to ensure that the pods that are managed
are run on all the cluster nodes.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

running a cluster storage daemon on every node
  - glusterd - ceph
running a logs collection daemon on every node
  - fluentd - logstash
running a node monitoring daemon on every node
  - Prometheus Node Exporter - collectd - Datadog agent
